# CSE-151A-Project

## Requirements:
### Data Exploration
- Read up on what the data means (Explain what the data is in a text cell)
- Visualize the data (display the DataFrame for features and targets)
- Look at a subsample of observations (Slice the data into training and testing sets? Remove extraneous features that add no value)
- Be one with the data 
### Preprocess Data
- Imputation (?)
- Normalization vs standardization
- Data Encoding: label encoding vs one hot encoding
- Data transformation
